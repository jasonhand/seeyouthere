# Features to Add

- When the modal for adding a new user is open, clicking outside of it should close it but let's also add a close button to the modal
- Styled for "mobile first"
- When I click on a festival at the bottom, display the month it is in on the calendar
- Results should show all the festivals where people are there together (with specific dates) but it should also display days that are NOT marked through the end of the year, and display a count of all of the available days where friends can meet.
